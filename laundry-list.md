- Add regex patterns for last name, passwords
- Figure out why email pattern accepts input w/o a domain
- Add tooltips or some direction to the user about what the restrictions are on
  input
- Figure out how to restrict phone number input without making it a reqd field
- Add JS password verification (for same password in each field)
- Consider removing valid input colors (feels kinda busy). User maybe only needs
  to know if their input is invalid. Valid could be assumed.
